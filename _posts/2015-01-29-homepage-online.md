Markus Huber will now be fully responsible for the whole WebApplications lecture. In order to simplify the organization everything has been transferred to GitHub, where all material will be available in form of repositories. The homepage itself is also hosted on GitHub, with Jekyll as the blog engine.

Each day is contained in its own repositories. The slides have been placed in another repository. The main advantages of using GitHub can be found in the transparent versioning, online browsing and content distribution. Additionally the time required for maintenance should be much smaller.
